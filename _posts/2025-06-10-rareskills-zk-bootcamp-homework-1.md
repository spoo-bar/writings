This post hosts my homework for my studies at the ZK Bootcamp conducted by [Rareskills](https://www.rareskills.io/zk-bootcamp).


> For all problems below, assume the finite field is p = 71.
>
> **Remember, this is done in a finite field so your answer should only contain numbers [0-70] inclusive. There should be no fractions or negative numbers.**


### Problem 1

Find the elements in a finite field that are congruent to the following values:

- -1
- -4
- -160
- 500

### Problem 2

Find the elements that are congruent to a = 5/6, b = 11/12, and c = 21/12

Verify your answer by checking that a + b = c (in the finite field)

### Problem 3

Find the elements that are congruent to a = 2/3, b = 1/2, and c = 1/3.

Verify your answer by checking that a * b = c (in the finite field)

### Problem 4

The inverse of a 2 x 2 matrix $A$ is
The inverse of a 2 x 2 matrix $A$ is

$$
A^{-1}=\frac{1}{\text{det}}\begin{bmatrix}d & -b\\-c & a\end{bmatrix}
$$

where $A$ is

$$
A = \begin{bmatrix}a & b\\c & d\end{bmatrix}
$$

And the determinant det is

$$
\text{det}=a \times d-b\times c
$$

Compute the inverse of the following matrix in the finite field:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}1 & 1\\1 & 4\end{bmatrix}
$$

Verify your answer by checking that

$$
AA^{-1}=I
$$

Where $I$ is the identity matrix.
